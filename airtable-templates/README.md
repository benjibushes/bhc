## ✅ **Table Names (MUST MATCH EXACTLY)**

After importing, rename tables to:
- `Consumers` (not "consumers.csv")
- `Ranchers`
- `Brands`
- `Land Deals` ← **WITH SPACE!**
- `Inquiries`
- `News`

---

## 🎯 **What Happens**

Airtable will:
- Auto-detect field types from data
- Create all columns
- Set up basic structure

You can then:
- Customize field types
- Add validation
- Create custom views
- Delete sample rows

---

## 📝 **Sample Data**

Each CSV has one sample row so Airtable can detect field types. **Delete these after import!**

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

**Import failed?**
- Make sure "First row contains field names" is checked
- CSV files must be UTF-8 encoded
- Try opening in Excel/Numbers and re-saving

**Field types wrong?**
- Click field name → Customize field type
- Change to correct type (Currency, Checkbox, etc.)

**App can't find tables?**
- Check table names match EXACTLY (case-sensitive!)
- `Land Deals` needs the space
