## Option 1: Calendly Setup (RECOMMENDED — 10 minutes)

### Why Calendly?
- Ranchers book directly without back-and-forth
- Auto-syncs with your Google Calendar
- Sends automatic reminders
- Free plan = 1 event type (perfect for onboarding calls)

### Setup Steps:

1. **Sign up for Calendly**
   - Go to: https://calendly.com/signup
   - Sign up with your Google account (connects calendar automatically)
   - Free plan is fine for now

2. **Create "Rancher Onboarding Call" event**
   - Click "New Event Type"
   - Name: "Rancher Onboarding Call"
   - Duration: 30 minutes
   - Location: Phone call or Zoom (your choice)
   - Description:
     ```
     Let's discuss your ranch operation, answer your questions, 
     and walk through how The HERD network works. This is a 
     casual conversation to make sure we're a good fit.
     
     I'll ask about your beef types, capacity, and practices.
     You can ask about member volume, pricing, and the process.
     
     Looking forward to connecting!

     ```

3. **Set your availability**
   - Go to "Availability" tab
   - Set your typical call hours (e.g., Mon-Fri 9am-5pm Central)
   - Buffer time: 15 min between calls (gives you time to take notes)

4. **Get your Calendly link**
   - Click "Copy Link" in your event type
   - Example: `https://calendly.com/benji-bhc/onboarding`

5. **Add to your .env.local file**
   ```
   CALENDLY_LINK="https://calendly.com/your-username/onboarding"
   ```

6. **Test it**
   - Open your Calendly link
   - Book a test appointment
   - Verify you receive confirmation email
   - Cancel test appointment

### Calendly Pro Tips:
- **Confirmation page:** Add a message like "Check your email for Zoom link and details"
- **Email reminders:** 24 hours before + 1 hour before (reduces no-shows)
- **Add questions:** "What's your biggest question about BuyHalfCow?" (captures concerns upfront)
- **Limit scheduling:** Only allow bookings 24-48 hours in advance (gives you breathing room)

---

## Option 2: Manual Scheduling (If You Skip Calendly)

If you don't set up Calendly right away, emails will show a "Book Your Call" button that links to:
```
mailto:support@buyhalfcow.com?subject=Schedule%20Onboarding%20Call
```

This opens their email client with:
- **To:** support@buyhalfcow.com
- **Subject:** "Schedule Onboarding Call"

They email you, you reply with times, book manually.

**This works fine for launch week**, but gets tedious fast. Calendly saves hours.

## Onboarding Call Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### Before the Call:

1. **Rancher applies** → You see application in `/admin` dashboard
2. **Review their info:**
   - Ranch name, location, beef types
   - Call availability (shows in admin dashboard)
   - Ranch tour interest (if checked)
3. **Rancher books call** via Calendly link in email (or emails you)
4. **You mark "Call Scheduled"** in admin dashboard (green button)
5. **Prep 5 minutes before:**
   - Pull up their application in `/admin`
   - Note their state, beef types, capacity
   - Check if they indicated ranch tour interest

### During the Call (20-30 minutes):

**Opening (5 min):**
- "Thanks for applying! Tell me about your ranch."
- Let them talk — take notes

**Questions to Ask (10 min):**
- How long have you been ranching?
- Walk me through your operation (grazing, finishing, processing)
- What makes your beef special/different?
- What's your typical monthly capacity?
- Do you currently sell direct-to-consumer? (If yes: how's it going?)
- What challenges do you face finding buyers?

**Explain The HERD (5 min):**
- Private network of 15,000+ verified members
- I vet every buyer (no tire-kickers, no spam)
- Members browse ranchers in their state
- When they request introduction, I review and facilitate
- You handle transaction directly (pricing, delivery, payment)
- Deposits flow through the platform to your Stripe account — you keep 100% of your price, the buyer pays our 10% fee on top (mention the model here)

**Next Steps (5 min):**
- If good fit: "I'll approve your application and we'll discuss ranch tour timing"
- Ranch tour: "I travel through [their state] certifying ranchers. When works for you?"
- Timeline: "Once certified, your listing goes live immediately"
- Questions from them

**Closing:**
- "I'll follow up via email within 24 hours with next steps"
- "Welcome to The HERD!"

### After the Call:

1. **Immediately:** Take notes in Airtable (add notes field if needed)
2. **Within 24 hours:**
   - Approve or reject in admin dashboard
   - If approved: Email them confirmation + next steps
   - If ranch tour interested: Propose dates for visit
3. **Track in Airtable:**
   - Mark "Call Scheduled" ✓
   - Update status to "Approved" or "Rejected"
   - Add notes about the call

## What to Look For (Red Flags vs Green Lights)

### ✅ Green Lights (Good Fit):
- Established operation (2+ years ranching)
- Clear practices (can explain their operation)
- Realistic capacity (not overpromising)
- Willing to have ranch tour
- Responsive and professional
- Understands they handle sales directly
- Comfortable with commission model

### 🚩 Red Flags (Reject or Investigate):
- Vague about operations ("we do a little bit of everything")
- No clear beef sourcing (reseller, not actual rancher)
- Unrealistic capacity (claims 100 head/month but small operation)
- Pushy about getting approved immediately
- Doesn't want ranch tour (suspicious)
- Poor communication (hard to reach, unprofessional)
- Just starting out (no track record)

**When in doubt:** Schedule ranch tour. In-person visit reveals everything.

---

## Commission Discussion (How to Bring It Up)

**During the call, around the 15-minute mark:**

> "So here's how the business model works. You keep 100% of your price. When a buyer reserves through BuyHalfCow, our 10% platform fee is added on top of your price and the buyer pays it with the deposit. It never comes out of your side. You set your pricing, the deposit lands in your Stripe account automatically, and there is nothing for you to track, remit, or get invoiced for. Simple, transparent, and every dollar of your number stays yours. Sound fair?"

**If they push back:**
- "The value you're getting is verified buyers only — no tire-kickers"
- "I'm vetting every member personally, so you only spend time on real opportunities"
- "I've built a 15,000-person audience. That access is valuable."
- "Plus, I'm personally certifying your ranch with an in-person tour. That stamp of approval matters."

**Most ranchers say yes immediately.** They're used to middlemen taking 20-40% out of THEIR side (distributors, retailers). A 10% fee the buyer pays on top — with the rancher keeping 100% of their price — is an easy yes.

## Scheduling Tips for Launch Week

You're onboarding **200 ranchers this week**. That's a lot of calls. Here's how to stay sane:

### Batch Your Calls:
- **Block specific hours:** e.g., "Mon/Wed/Fri 9am-1pm = Rancher calls only"
- **Limit daily calls:** Max 6-8 calls per day (30 min each = 3-4 hours + buffer)
- **Weekend calls:** If ranchers work weekdays, offer Saturday morning slots

### Use Calendly's Features:
- **Date range limits:** Only allow bookings 2-3 weeks out (spreads them out)
- **Daily limits:** Max 8 bookings per day
- **Buffer time:** 15 min between calls (sanity breaks)

### Keep Notes Simple:
- Use Airtable "Notes" field (add if needed)
- Quick template:
  ```
  Call Date: [Date]
  Duration: [20/30 min]
  Summary: [Established grass-fed operation, 50 acres, 20 head/month, good fit]
  Next Steps: [Approve + schedule ranch tour for March]
  Red Flags: [None]
  ```

### Don't Over-Schedule:
- You're fried. Launch week is intense.
- **Recommendation:** Schedule 30-40 calls this week, 50-60 next week, rest in Week 3-4.
- It's okay to have a 2-3 week backlog. Better than burning out.

### Post-Call Follow-Up: REJECTED (Use Sparingly)

**Subject:** Re: Rancher Application — BuyHalfCow

Hi [Rancher Name],

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about joining The HERD network.

After reviewing your operation, I don't think it's the right fit at this time. [Optional brief reason: "We're prioritizing established operations with 2+ years of direct-to-consumer sales experience right now."]

I appreciate your interest and wish you the best with your ranch.

— Benji

## FAQ for Ranchers (During Calls)

**Q: How many buyers will I get?**
A: Depends on your state and beef type. Popular states (TX, CO, MT, KS) get more volume. You might see 2-3 inquiries per month early on, more as The HERD grows. Quality over quantity — these are vetted, serious buyers.

**Q: Can I set my own prices?**
A: Absolutely. You control pricing, payment terms, delivery, everything. I just facilitate the introduction.

**Q: What if I sell out?**
A: Just let me know. I'll pause your listing until you have capacity again. Flexible.

**Q: Do I have to take every buyer you send?**
A: Nope. If someone requests an introduction and it doesn't feel right, just tell me. You're in control.

**Q: When do I pay commission?**
A: You don't — ever. The 10% platform fee is added on top of your price and the buyer pays it with the deposit through Stripe. Nothing is invoiced to you, and there is nothing for you to report or remit.

**Q: What happens during the ranch tour?**
A: I visit for 1-2 hours, tour the property, see the operation, meet the cattle, document practices with photos/video. It's casual, not an inspection. I'm just verifying you're legit and your beef is quality.
